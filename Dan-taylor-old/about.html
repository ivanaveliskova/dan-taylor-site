<p align="center">Daniel Lee Tran & Taylor Elizabeth Kinney first began their partnership in June of 2011. Within their first year of competition, they managed to seize numerous amateur titles both in the International Latin and American Rhythm category. By March of 2012, they claimed the United States National American Rhythm title and remained undefeated in the Rhythm category for the remainder of their amateur careers, defending their title in 2013 as well as claiming the World Cup title during both years.

<p align="center">Dan and Taylor made the final leap and turned Professional in November of 2013, initially taking a hiatus from competition to focus on studies as well as Pro/Am. They returned to the dance floor as a couple in the summer of 2014 and have achieved very strong results right off the bat, consistently landing in top placements in the Rising Star events and strong finishes in the Open division. Together, they are well on their way towards making a name for themselves in the Professional divisions.

<p align="center">Besides competition, Dan and Taylor have also participated in many exciting events, including the Dancing with the Stars' 2011 "Ballroom Battle," the 2012 "Dancing with San Francisco's Stars" gala, the 2013 & 2014 Stanford Viennese Ball, the 2013 South Bay Yelp "Art of Entertainment" kickoff party, and the 2014 TEDxStanford event to name a few. The two have also made tremendous contributions towards education in ballroom dancing, having worked with young students involved with Stanford University's dance programs as well as American Rhythm dancers across the nation who have been inspired by what the team of two have accomplished together.  

<p align="center">Dan & Taylor have been lucky enough to train with some of the top coaches in the world. The list includes Felipe & Carolina Telona, Jose DeCamps, Valentina Kostenko, Gary McDonald, Viktoriya Franova, Taliat Tarsinov, Eugene Katsevman, Giacomo Stecagglia, and most importantly, Steve Vasco.

<p align="justify">Taylor is a contagiously positive person who LOVES to share her passion for dance with others through teaching and performance. She is high on life and drunk on music… and she likes it that way! A charismatic, natural performer, Taylor lights up with the music and strives to spread joy and provoke emotion with her performance.
 
<p align="justify">After beginning her training in contemporary dance and ballet at a young age, Taylor was drawn to the beauty of connection in partner dancing and started training competitively in International Standard and Latin Ballroom in high school. Taylor fell in love with the music and style of American Rhythm, and she now competes professionally in Rhythm with her partner, Dan Tran. Taylor’s favorite part about ballroom is that it is not only an athletic and artistic outlet, but it is also a space to explore and express human connection.
 
<p align="justify">After recently graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford University with a double major in Psychology and English, Taylor is now an executive recruiter at Spencer Stuart by day and a dancer by night. Taylor teaches private lessons, offers group classes, and choreographs for musicals as well as coaching for the Stanford Salsa team (Los Salseros de Stanford). Taylor’s goal as a dance teacher and coach is to help her students gain the confidence, awareness, and technique to fully enjoy and express both the music and their connection to their partners. She specializes in American Rhythm, as well as International Latin, International Standard, American Smooth, Salsa, Swing, Hustle, Nightclub Two Step, Jazz, and Contemporary.
